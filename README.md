## UPENN_DSBC_Belly_Button_Challenge

##### Challenge Link: https://crainsk269.github.io/UPENN_DSBC_Belly_Button_Challenge/

##### For this challenge I went back and re-watched all three lectures as well as re-worked all of the student assignments. I had to lookup how to deploy the app to GitHub Pages. That took a while as I went to GitHub for instructions and watched multiple tutorial videos on YouTube. After a few tries I finally got it to work. I also used the https://plotly.com/javascript/ link, that was supplied in the Module 14 Challenge instructions, for the charts. Other sites like Stack Overflow and W3Schools were not referenced for this challenge.
