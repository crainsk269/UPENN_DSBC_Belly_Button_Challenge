## UPENN_DSBC_Belly_Button_Challenge

##### For this challenge I went back and re-watched all three lectures as well as re-worked all of the student assignments. I used the https://plotly.com/javascript/ link, that was supplied in the Module 14 Challenge instructions, for the charts. Other sites like Stack Overflow and W3Schools were not referenced for this challenge. I had to lookup how to deploy the app to GitHub Pages. That took a while as I went to GitHub for instructions and watched multiple tutorial videos on YouTube. I finally figured it out and then I tried to update the index.html so that when you clicked on the link it would open up in a new browser window. I was unsuccessful in my attempts which also lead to me messing up some other things that I couldn't figure out how to fix. Ultimately, I wound up deleting the repository and creating a new one and starting all over.
